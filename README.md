# 🐥 Chick-in

A simple habit check-in app built with **Kotlin** and **Jetpack Compose**.

---

## 📱 Overview

This app was created as a personal practice project, inspired by a small family-run business process that involved handling structured number inputs, generating formatted messages, and forwarding them via WhatsApp.

The goal was to automate a previously manual routine — making it faster, less error-prone, and more efficient under time constraints.

While the original business context is kept private, this challenge gave me the opportunity to apply Jetpack Compose concepts in a meaningful way, and build a fully functional multi-screen Android app from scratch.

## 🙋‍♀️ About Me

This was my first Android project using Kotlin and Jetpack Compose.  
It represents part of my journey to turn real-world needs into working code.  
I'm currently exploring full-stack development and mobile UI/UX design through hands-on projects like this one.
